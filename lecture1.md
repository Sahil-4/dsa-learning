# DSA Notes

### Basic terminology

1. Data Structures : containers to store data.
2. Algorithm : Logic to perform operations on data.
3. Flowchart : Diagramatic approach to solve a problem.
4. Pseudo Code : Simple way of representing the logic.

### Flowchart compomemts

1. Terminator : Used to show Start and End of the program.
   ![terminator](https://)

2. Process : Used to show operations or processes.
   ![process](http://)

3. Process : Used to show operations or processes.
   ![process](http://)

4. Input/ Output :
   ![i/o](http://)

5. Decision : Used to show decision statements in a program, where answer is usually Yes/true or No/false.
   ![decision](http://)

6. Arrow : Shows relationships between different shapes.
   ![arrow](http://)

7. On-page Connector : Connects two or more parts of a flowchart on the same page.
   ![connector1](http://)

8. Off-page Connector : Connects two parts of a flowchart which are spread over different pages.
   ![connector2](http://)

### Pseudo Code : Logic to solve a problem written in plain english.

#### Examples of Flowcharts

1. Flowchart to print hello.
   ![flowchart_hello](http://)

2. Flowchart to calculate sum of two numbers.
   ![flowchart_2sum](http://)

3. Flowchart to calculate average of three numbers.
   ![flowchart_3avg](http://)

4. Flowchart to check wether a number is odd or even
   ![flowchart_oddeven](http://)

5. Flowchart to check wether a triangle is valid or not
   ![flowchart_validtriangle](http://)

6. Flowchart to print counting 1 to n
   ![flowchart_counting](http://)

7. Flowchart to check if n is a prime number
   ![flowchart_prime](http://)

#### Examples of Pseudo Code

1. Pseudo Code to print Hello.
   `1. Start`
   `2. print Hello`
   `3. End`

2. Pseudo Code to calculate sum of two numbers.
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input a and b`
   `3. Process c = a + b`
   `4. Print c`
   `5. End`

3. Pseudo Code to calculate average of three numbers.
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input a, b and c`
   `3. Calculate avg = (a + b + c)/3`
   `4. Print avg`
   `5. End`

4. Pseudo code to check wether a number is odd or even
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input n`
   `3. Check if n is devisible by 2`
   `4. if n is devisible by 2 print even`
   `5. if n is not devisible by 2 print odd`
   `6. End`

5. Pseudo Code to check wether a triangle is valid or not
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input of a, b, c (all three sides of triangle)`
   `3. Check below conditions`
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a. a+b < c`
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a. b+c < a`
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a. c+a < b`
   `4. if above condition is true then given triangle is valid`
   `5. if above condition is false then given triangle is not valid`
   `6. End`

6. Pseudo code to print counting 1 to n
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input n`
   `3. initialise i = 1`
   `4. if i < n print i and then increment value of i by 1`
   `5. if i is not less then n End`

7. Pseudo code to check if n is a prime number
   `1. Start`
   `2. Take input n`
   `3. initialise i = 2`
   `4. check if i is less then n if yes continue else End the program`
   `5. check if n is divisible by i if yes then print not prime and End the program`
   `6. if n is not divisible by i increament i by 1`
   `7. End`

### Approach to solve a problem

Take problem --> Understand Problem --> Read given hints --> Think for approach --> Code --> Compile --> Run
