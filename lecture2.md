```

##### Journey of a program from writing to executing

Programming Instructions --> Source Code --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> execute

##### Run below command to compile the above C program

`gcc main.c -o main`

##### Run below command to execute/run the above C compiled program

`./main.exe`

### Compiler

1. Convert source code into machine code
2. Show errors if any

Entry point of a program : main function (line number 3 in above program)

### IDE

1. Program where we can write and run our code
2. IDE also helps us to debug our code

### Programming language :

A language to write computer instructions

Variables : to store data we use variables

Datatype : datatype defines the type of data stored in a variable.
There are so many different datatypes like : int, char, string, bool, float etc.

Data stored in memory in the form of binary.
first data is converted into binary then this is being stored in memory.

Type casting : conversion of data from one type to another.

Operator : operators are used to perform operations on data.
There are many types of operators like Arithmatic operator, Logical operator, Relational operator, Binary operator etc.
